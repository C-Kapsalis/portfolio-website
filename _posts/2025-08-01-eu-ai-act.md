## 1. The EU AI Act: A Risk-Based Framework

### Risk Classification

- **Unacceptable Risk**  
  Prohibits uses such as manipulative “social scoring” and untargeted biometric surveillance.

- **High Risk**  
  Covers systems affecting critical infrastructure, safety-critical products, and fundamental rights (e.g. AI-driven recruitment tools).

- **Limited & Minimal Risk**  
  Imposes transparency requirements for “chatbots” and low-risk applications (e.g. spam filters).

### Key Obligations for High-Risk AI

1. **Data Governance & Quality**  
   Rigorous data management, bias mitigation, and record-keeping.  
2. **Technical Documentation**  
   Submit detailed technical files, model cards, and user-guides.  
3. **Conformity Assessments**  
   Undergo internal or third-party audits prior to market entry.

**Enforcement:** Non-compliance may incur fines up to 7 % of global turnover or product bans, underscoring the Act’s stringent enforcement.

## 2. GPAI Code of Practice: From Guidance to Compliance

In anticipation of the AI Act’s GPAI provisions (effective August 2025), the European Commission has published a **voluntary Code of Practice**. Once adopted by Member States, signatories can self-certify adherence to GPAI rules, reducing legal uncertainty.

### Core Principles

- **Transparency & Explainability**  
  Publish model cards, data sheets, and intended use cases.  
- **Safety & Robustness**  
  Implement stress tests, adversarial resilience protocols, and incident-response processes.  
- **Governance & Oversight**  
  Establish clear accountability structures and human-in-the-loop controls.  
- **Fundamental Rights**  
  Conduct privacy impact assessments and implement redress mechanisms.

By codifying best practices, the GPAI Code becomes the de facto roadmap for responsible GenAI development in Europe.

## 3. Implications for Tech Startups

### Compliance Challenges

- **Up-front Investment**  
  Legal, technical, and governance resources must be allocated well before commercialization.  
- **Documentation Overhead**  
  Creating and maintaining model cards, audit logs, and risk assessments can slow product iteration.  
- **Data Demands**  
  High-risk use cases require demonstrable data lineage, quality controls, and bias mitigation.

### Strategic Opportunities

- **Trust & Differentiation**  
  Early adopters of the Code signal reliability to regulators and customers—unlocking pilot projects and public-sector engagements.  
- **Market Access**  
  Self-certification streamlines conformity processes across Member States, accelerating time-to-market.  
- **Partnership Potential**  
  Startups proficient in EU compliance can collaborate with established integrators seeking “plug-and-play” compliant AI modules.

## 4. Recommendations for Startups

1. **Integrate Compliance into Development**  
   Embed documentation, testing, and governance into your CI/CD pipelines.  
2. **Sign the GPAI Code Early**  
   Gain administrative relief and legal clarity through self-certification.  
3. **Adopt Compliance Toolkits**  
   Leverage open-source solutions (e.g. model-card generators, siMMMulator) to automate reporting.  
4. **Engage Local Expertise**  
   Partner with EU-based legal and risk consultancies to navigate Member-State nuances.  
5. **Communicate Transparently**  
   Publish your compliance artifacts (model cards, impact statements) publicly to build stakeholder confidence.
