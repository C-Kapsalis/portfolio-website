## File Descriptions

- **`AML_Kapsalis_Stavrogiannis_Tzoras.docx`**  
  A detailed report outlining the project background, data preprocessing, methodology, results, and conclusions.

- **`classification_part.ipynb`**  
  Implements supervised classification techniques such as logistic regression, decision trees, and possibly ensemble methods. Includes model evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrices.

- **`clustering_part.ipynb`**  
  Applies unsupervised learning to discover structure in the data. Techniques likely include k-means, DBSCAN, or hierarchical clustering, with accompanying visualizations.

- **`regression_part.ipynb`**  
  Focuses on predicting continuous outcomes using linear regression, regularized models, and error metrics such as MAE, MSE, and R².

## Getting Started

To run the notebooks:

1. Install dependencies using your preferred environment manager.
2. Open each `.ipynb` file in Jupyter or VSCode.
3. Follow along with the cells; most are self-contained and annotated.

## Notes

- All notebooks are intended to be executed sequentially from top to bottom.
- Ensure required datasets (if any) are provided or loaded from the correct paths.
